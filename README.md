# uber-lyft-weather-price-prediction

This project analyzes Uber and Lyft ride prices in Boston during November–December 2018, using ride data merged with weather data to understand key price drivers and build predictive models.

---

## Data

- [Kaggle: Uber & Lyft Cab Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices)
- Includes over 600,000 rides and weather data for Boston

---

## Objectives

- Explore how factors like distance, vehicle type, time, and weather affect ride prices
- Build models to predict price using these features

---

## Methods

- Data cleaning, merging, and EDA
- Visualizations: histograms, box plots, heatmaps, Folium maps
- Models:
  - Linear Regression (baseline)
  - Random Forest (tuned, R² ≈ 0.92)
  - Neural Network (best, R² ≈ 0.92)
